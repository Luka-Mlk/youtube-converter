# Youtube converter

##### A simple youtube to mp3 converter built with the [YouTube MP3](https://rapidapi.com/ytjar/api/youtube-mp36) API

## Getting started

After installing or cloning the repo on your machine you will need to create a `.env` file in which you will add the following

> API_KEY=`YOUR KEY`\
>  API_HOST=`HOST`\
>  PORT=`DESIRED PORT`

The port field is not mandatory and if not added the app will default to port **3000**

Now having done that navigate to the youtube-compiler folder in your terminal of choice and run

- `npm install`

Congratulations you are pretty much doneðŸŽ‰

All you need to do is choose how you want to run the application

`npm run dev` for development

or

`npm run live` for the live version

Development time ~5h
